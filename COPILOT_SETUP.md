- `cs2-common`: 5 seconds ‚úÖ
- `cs2-data-pipeline`: 90 seconds ‚ö†Ô∏è
- `cs2-ml`: 2+ minutes ‚ö†Ô∏è (platform dependent)

### Processing Expectations
- **Demo Parsing**: 700MB+/second target

## üîç Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Issues
```bash
# Check Node.js version (requires 18+)
node --version

# Reinstall dependencies
cd .mcp-servers && npm install

# Test server connectivity
./setup_mcp_servers.sh
```

### Copilot Not Using Enhanced Features
1. **Verify files exist**:
   ```bash
   ls -la .github/copilot*.json .mcp/settings.json
   ```

2. **Check VS Code Copilot settings**:
   - Ensure Copilot and Copilot Chat extensions are enabled
   - Restart VS Code after configuration changes

3. **Database MCP requires running services**:
   ```bash
   ./setup_databases.sh
   docker compose ps  # Verify all services are Up
   ```

### Common Issues
- **Build timeouts**: Increase timeout expectations, builds take 2-5 minutes
- **Linux Metal errors**: MCP will suggest `--no-default-features` for cs2-ml
- **Database connections**: MCP will verify service health before operations
- **Demo parsing memory**: MCP monitors and suggests appropriate resource limits

## üéñÔ∏è Advanced Features
